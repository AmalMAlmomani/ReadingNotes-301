# Introduction to SQL(Structured Query Language)
  -  language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.
  -  provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.
  
## Relational databases
     Before learning the SQL syntax, itâ€™s important to have a model for what a relational database actually is. A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

 - *For example*, if the Department of Motor Vehicles had a database, you might find a table containing all the known vehicles that people in the state are driving.
