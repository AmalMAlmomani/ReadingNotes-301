# JQuery
  -  **jQuery offers:** a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed.

  - **SELECT ELEMENTS:** It is simpler to access elements using jQuery’s CSS-style selectors than it is using DOM queries.The selectors are also more powerful and flexible.

  - **PERFORM TASKS:** jQuery’s methods let you update the DOM tree, animate elements into and out of view, and loop through a set of elements,all in one line of code.

  - **HANDLE EVENTS:** jQuery includes methods that allow you to attach event listeners to selected elements without having to write any tailback code to support older browsers.


## WHY USE JQUERY?
    - jQuery doesn’t do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.


## We can create attributes, or access and update their contents, using the following four methods:
   - `.attr()`
   - `.removeAttr()`
   - `.addClass()`
   - `.removeClass()`

- **The `.css()` method let us retrieve and set the values of CSS properties.**
